# Generalization over Enumeration: Mathematical Ideas for Python Testing

**Work in Progress**

This open-source book explores how mathematical ideas—such as generalization, properties, and abstraction—can help you write more powerful and concise Python tests. The focus is on property-based testing using [Hypothesis](https://hypothesis.works/).

Feedback is welcome as this book develops.
